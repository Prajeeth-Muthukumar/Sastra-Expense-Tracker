How to Run the Website!!!
  Due to Some Error I was not Able to Deploy this Website.
  So, to run this website:
  1. Download all the files in the directory
  2. Run the backend.py file(make sure you have flask and FlaskSQLAlchemy Installed)
  3. Once you run the file you'll get a website in your local host
  4. Get to It and You'll Be Able to Access the Website
